                <p>
                  We are Mister Appliance ("<strong>Company</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," "<strong>our</strong>"), a company registered in California, United States at North Little Rock, Arkansas, USA.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                  Mister Appliance was founded on the principle that household repairs should be handled with the same level of precision as industrial maintenance. We recognize that modern appliances are complex electronic systems that require specialized knowledge and calibrated tools for effective servicing.

                <p>
                  You can contact us by email at <a href="mailto:info@misterappliance.shop">info@misterappliance.shop</a>, or by mail to North Little Rock, Arkansas, USA.

It is your responsibility to periodically review these Legal Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Legal Terms by your continued use of the Services after the date such revised Legal Terms are posted.</p>
